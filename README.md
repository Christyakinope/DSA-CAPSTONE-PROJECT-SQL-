### ‚ùì Q11: Did the company appropriately align shipping methods with order priorities?

**Answer:**

Based on the data, the company has **not appropriately aligned shipping methods with order priorities**.

- üöö **Delivery Truck**, while being the **most expensive and slowest** option, is used **extensively for Low and Medium priority orders**.
- ‚úàÔ∏è **Express Air** ‚Äî the **fastest and cheapest** method ‚Äî is **underutilized for Critical orders**.

üîç A more efficient approach would be to:
- Use **fast shipping methods like Express Air** for **high-priority orders**
- Reserve **economical options like Delivery Truck** for **low-priority shipments**

This change would help optimize both **cost** and **service level**, improving logistics and customer satisfaction.
